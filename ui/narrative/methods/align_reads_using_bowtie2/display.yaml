parameters :
    sampleset_id :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq Sample or Sample Set 
        short-hint : |
            Select the RNA-seq read sample set associated with the RNA-seq experiment. Alternatively, if you have only one sample of RNA-seq reads, select the corresponding library object.
    bowtie_index :
        ui-name : |
            Indexed Genome
        short-hint : |
            Select the indexed genome built using Bowtie2
    alignment_type :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the alignment type
        long-hint : |
            By default, Bowtie2 performs end-to-end read alignment. It searches for alignments involving all of read characters. For local option, it can clip some read characters from one or both ends of the alignment to maximize the alignment score.
    quality_score :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Quality Score Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the quality score type depending on the sequencing platform
        long-hint : |
            phred33 is used by Illumina starting with v1.8
    preset_options :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Type Preset Options
        short-hint : |
            Select the preset options based on alignment type
        long-hint : |
            Faster option is generally less sensitive and vice versa.
    num_threads :
        ui-name : |
            Number of Threads
        short-hint : |
            Number of computational threads to align reads.
    trim5 :
        ui-name : |
            Trim Bases From 5'end
        short-hint : |
            Trim the base-pairs from 5' (left) end of each read before alignment
        long-hint : |
            Trim the base-pairs from 5' end before alignment, if needed. By default, it is 0. 
    trim3 :
        ui-name : |
            Trim Bases From 3'end
        short-hint : |
            Trim the base-pairs from 3' (right) end of each read before alignment
        long-hint : |
            Trim the base-pairs from 3' end before alignment, if needed. By default, it is 0.
    np :
        ui-name : |
            Penalty
        short-hint : |
            Sets the penalty for positions where the read, reference, or both, contain an ambiguous character such as N. 
        long-hint : |
            By default, penalty is 1. 
    minins :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Fragment Length For Paired-end Alignments
        short-hint : |
            Select the minimum fragment length for valid untrimmed paired-end alignments 
        long-hint : |
            By default, 0 is used. 
    maxins :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Fragment Length For Paired-end Alignments
        short-hint : |
            Select the maximum fragment length for valid untrimmed paired-end alignments
        long-hint : |
            By default, 500 is used. 
    orientation :
        ui-name : |
            Orientation
        short-hint : |
            Select the upstream/downstream mate orientations for a valid paired-end alignments against the forward reference strand. 
        long-hint : |
            By default, fr is used. 
            
description : |
    <p>This method aligns the sequencing reads for a set of two or more samples to long reference sequences of a prokaryotic genome using Bowtie2 and outputs a set of alignments for the given sample set in BAM format. Alternatively, if the user has only a single sample of reads, this method will take single-end or paired-end library object instead of a sample set.</p> 
    
    <p>In addition, it outputs the alignment statistics such as total reads, mapped and unmapped reads, singletons, multiple alignments, and alignment rate in the table format.</p>
    
    <p>Bowtie2 supports end-to-end read alignment mode by default. In this mode, it searches for alignments involving all of the read characters. This is also called an "untrimmed" or "unclipped" alignment. The method also supports "local" alignment mode, which produces alignments that might be "trimmed" (or "soft clipped") at one or both extremes in a way that optimizes the alignment score.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone for one or more RNA-seq samples.</p>
