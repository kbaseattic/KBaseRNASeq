parameters :
    sampleset_id :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq Sample Set
        short-hint : |
            Name of the RNA-seq sample set output object.
    sampleset_desc :
        ui-name : |
            Sample Set Description
        short-hint : |
            The detailed description of the input RNA-seq samples
    platform :
        ui-name : |
            Platform
        short-hint : |
            The platform used for sequencing (e.g Illumina)
    Library_type :
        ui-name : |
            Library Type
        short-hint : |
            The type of sequencing reads - single-end vs. paired-end 
    condition:
        ui-name : |
            Condition Labels
        short-hint : |
            Short label for each sample in the RNA-seq experiment. All replicates for the same condition must have same label.
    sample_id:
        ui-name : |
            Reads (Single-end/Paired-end)
        short-hint : |
            Select the single-end or paired-end reads files based on the type of sequencing reads.
    domain :
        ui-name : |
            Domain 
        short-hint : |
            The domain of the genome - prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes
    source :
        ui-name : |
            Source
        short-hint : |
            The source of the data used for RNA-seq experiment (e.g NCBI)

        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq Sample and Condition
        short-hint : |
            For each sample, select the sample and provide the short label for condition. All replicates for the same condition must have same label.

    <p>This App allows the users to select the single-end or paired-end read files and provide the metadata for a set of samples to create RNASeqSampleSet object. Note that the user must provide reads for two or more samples.</p>
    
    <p>Users need to import single-end or paired-end read files to the Data Pane before starting this App.</p>
    
    <p>It is mandatory for users to select the "Library Type", "Domain", "RNA-seq Sample and Condition Labels" and provide the "RNA-seq Sample Set" (RNASeqSampleSet object name). All replicates for the same condition must have same label.</p>
    
    <p>Users can optionally fill in additional metadata information in the advanced options.</p>
