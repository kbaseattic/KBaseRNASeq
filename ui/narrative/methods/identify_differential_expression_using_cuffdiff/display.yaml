description : |
    <p>This method is used to find significant changes in transcript expression using cuffdiff.</p>
    <p>It accepts GTF annotation file produced by cuffmerge and SAM files of aligned RNAseq reads as input. If more than two SAM files are provided, cuffdiff tests for differential expression between all pairs of samples.</p>
    <p>Cuffdiff calculates the FPKM of each transcript, primary transcript and gene in each sample and produces differentially expressed files.</p>
